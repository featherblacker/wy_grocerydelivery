## Introduction

This SPA website is what I developed when I served as volunteer in OCMA(Ottawa Chinese Musician's Association).
 The reason why I established this project is to provide a web platform for people to order online. Due to COVID-19,
  people feel stressed and unsafe to go outdoors, especially for those crowded indoor places. The team OCMA spontaneously
 launched a project to deliver food and daily necessities to the residents of Ottawa, mainly for those international students
 and elders. Clients can easily log in our website and order merchandises freely. In this process, they need to provide
 the basic delivery information, such as nickname, contact number and address. Delivery fee will be automatically calculated 
 when the target delivery place is filled. 

## Project Analysis

The grocery delivery project technically consists of three parts: front-end website, back-end server and database.
For the back-end development and database setup, a great team done these and wrote Restful API document for the front-end, 
which is helpful. By checking the API document, I can easily transfer these get and post requests. The front-end part is built
 with ReactJS library, which is a pretty popular way to deal with client service. The building of front-end would follow the 
 UI/UX design rules. The user should feel comfortable and enjoyment when using services.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
